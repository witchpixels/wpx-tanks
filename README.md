# WitchPixels' Tanks

The base of a larger Wii Tanks clone that I want to eventually build. The code here will be kept as close to any
commercialized spin-off as is practical because the established norm of fanatical secrecy in the games industry is 
cringe, yo.

I know there are a few wii tanks clones out there, but this was a game really near and dear to teenaged me, and later
seeing the little subtle mechanics in it as an adult with some years making games professionally I can see how there was
a lot more going on with it than it had any right to have and it's a shame that it's slowly becoming somewhat lost media
from an era where a majority of games have slowly been rendered unplayable.
